                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The goal of this project: produce a small drone that mimics the dynamics of a lunar lander, provides 60 seconds of flight time, is affordable, reusable, and will allow me to fly new and interesting guidance, navigation, and control systems.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">I wrote vehicle physics simulations at 9 years old. After scrambling between interests of math, physics, and programming, I finally discovered the rocket landing problem and became intrigued. Since then, it is all I think about. I have written countless rocket landing simulations and taught myself optimal and predictive control, optimal state estimation, and optimal guidance along with the math.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="mb-0">However, flying it is the thing that makes you the subject matter expert; because you are able to perform analysis on performance, and drive requirements for the next time. The difference is flying it - the ultimate demonstration.</p>
